'''This package contains datatypes, functions and classes
that are needed to keep track of qwirkle games as they progress.

For the time being, functionality convenient for analysing
positions and games are kept here. But anything not essential to
keeping track of a game of qwirkle as it unfolds, may
be moved elsewhere.'''
